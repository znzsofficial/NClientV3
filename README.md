# NClientV3

[![Github](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/maxwai/NClientV3.svg?logo=github)](https://github.com/maxwai/NClientV3/releases/latest)

An unofficial NHentai Android Client. This is a fork of the original Project by [@Dar9586](https://github.com/Dar9586) found [here](https://github.com/Dar9586/NClientV2)

This app  works for devices from API 28 (Android 9) and above.

Releases: <https://github.com/maxwai/NClientV3/releases>

## Migrate from original NClientV2 to NClientV3

Unfortunately, due to Android security features, it is not possible to create an APK that will update the original App since the same signature will not be possible. For that reason a migration is necessary.

1. If not already done, move your download folder to outside the protected folders in `Settings -> Folder location`
   1. There are a lot of tutorials online on how to access `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data`. For example here from [medium.com](https://medium.com/@naira-nicol/how-to-access-android-data-folder-c0227e0a42ef)
   2. Be sure to not move it to `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data` but to a folder that your normal file app can see it. (Notice: `/storage/emulated/0/nclient` would work for example for a new path)
2. Rename the subfolder in the path you set from `NClientV2` to `NClientV3`
3. Export your data in `Settings -> Export data`
   1. IMPORTANT: wait for the pop up message saying `Export finished`
4. Open NClientV3
5. Set the download folder in `Settings -> Folder location` to the same path as in NClientV2
6. Import your data in `Settings -> Import data`, choose the zip file you created in Step 3
   1. IMPORTANT: wait for the pop up message saying `Import finished`
